# Advanced Insurance Charges Forecasting

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of Linear and Polynomial Regression models for predicting individual medical costs billed by a health insurance provider. The models leverage various individual characteristics such as age, sex, BMI, region, number of children, and smoking habits to estimate medical costs.

## Dataset

The prediction models are trained on a dataset that includes comprehensive information about individuals, allowing for a nuanced analysis of the factors influencing medical costs. The dataset comprises entries for different individuals, each with attributes such as age, sex, BMI, region, number of children, and smoking habits, along with corresponding medical costs billed by the health insurance provider.

## Models

### 1. Linear Regression

Linear Regression is employed to establish a linear relationship between the input features and the predicted medical costs. This model assumes a linear combination of the input features to estimate the target variable.

### 2. Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression extends the linear model by introducing polynomial terms. This allows for a more flexible fit to the data, capturing non-linear relationships between the input features and medical costs.

## Usage

To use the prediction models, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (ensure you have a working Python environment).
3. Load your dataset or use the provided sample dataset.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script corresponding to the desired regression model (Linear or Polynomial).
5. Input the individual characteristics for which you want to predict medical costs.
6. Obtain the predicted medical costs based on the trained model.

Feel free to experiment with different datasets or tweak the model hyperparameters for your specific use case.
